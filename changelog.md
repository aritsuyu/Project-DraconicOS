### Day 3 — 12/08/2025
- Added **MemReduct** in `Engine/Tools`, but it is not working yet.
- `OS.py` is deprecated (I am creating a new schematic for it).
- Changed `icontinter` documentation to English and improved explanations.
- Created `cmds.md` — it explains the future commands that will allow you to run them in the Draconic terminal to change everything in the OS (offering more control than the future app, including dangerous commands).
- Created `changelog.md` to document all changes made over time.
- Preview from a new a Ui
